## Summary

I have been employed by the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary's Technical Services Section since May 2017. I started, at that time, as a Forensic Video Technician. In that role, I was certified by LEVA, and performed over 100 extractions from DVR and NVR systems around the north-east Avalon region. In July 2019 I transitioned into a Computer Forensic Examiner role. I am currently in training and intend to attend the Canadian Police College's Computer Forensics course in January 2020. I also hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. Prior to joining the RNC I was employed in the Information Technology field for over 10 years.
